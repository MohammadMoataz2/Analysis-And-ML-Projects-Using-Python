# Analysis and ML Projects using Python

## Description
This repository contains a collection of analysis and machine learning projects implemented in Python. The projects cover various domains and utilize different techniques to gain insights from data and build predictive models.

## Folder Structure
- **Machine Learning:**
  - **Supervised:**
    - **Diabetes Classification:**
      - **Description:** This project focuses on predicting the risk of diabetes based on various health indicators such as age, pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc. The analysis delves into the relationships between these features and the diabetes outcome, providing insights into the factors affecting the condition. A machine learning model is developed to classify individuals into diabetic or non-diabetic categories.

- **Analysis:**
  - **Fast Food Analysis:**
    - **Description:** This analysis focuses on exploring nutritional information from fast-food restaurants. It covers various attributes such as calories, fat content, cholesterol, etc., for different menu items. The analysis identifies trends such as the restaurants with the lowest calorie averages and examines the relationship between nutritional components. Additionally, menus are constructed for each restaurant, detailing meal compositions and nutritional values.
